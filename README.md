# VencordPlugins
All of the public Vencord plugins I've worked on.

> [!NOTE]
> At the moment these plugins (there's only one at the moment) can only be installed manually, you can find a guide on how to install the Development Build of Vencord [here](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/blob/main/docs/1_INSTALLING.md) and the Plugins Guide [here](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/blob/main/docs/2_PLUGINS.md).

## Bunny Girls
Adds a built-in command to post a random gif of a bunny girl in chat.
